\section mandatory-dependencies Mandatory dependencies
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project is versatile and can be used to compile only some components.

The minimum required dependencies are `Eigen3` and `iDynTree`. If you want to build the tests please remember to install `Catch2`. If you are interested in the python bindings generation please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system.


\section exported-components Exported components

The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** project consists of several components. The components are stored in the [`src`](https://github.com/dic-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/tree/master/src) folder and their compilation depends on the installed dependencies.

\section build-the-suite Build the suite
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework**  can be built on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The easiest way to compile the library is to use the [`robotology-superbuild`](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild). If you enable the profiles  `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS` and `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS_FULL_DEPS` in the `robotology-superbuild` you will automatically clone and build **bipedal-locomotion-framework** and all the dependencies.

If you do not want to use the `robotology-superbuild` you can manually compile the code in the repository running the following command in the terminal

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
git clone https://github.com/dic-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework.git
cd bipedal-locomotion-framework
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Remark:** If you manually compile the framework remember to install the dependencies required by the component you are interested in.

\section some-utilities Some utilities

The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** ships also some utilities that can help you in the everyday tests on a real robot. You can find them in the [`utilities` folder](https://github.com/dic-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/tree/master/utilities). Each utility contains a well-documented` README` where you can find further details.

\section python Python

**bipedal-locomotion-framework** provides also python bindings. Only a small set of the components implemented in the library have the corresponding python bindings.

If you want to compile the bindings please install `python3` and `pybind11` in your system then you can run the following `CMake` command in your `build` folder

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/where/you/want/to/install> \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DFRAMEWORK_COMPILE_PYTHON_BINDINGS:BOOL=ON \
      -DPython3_ROOT_DIR=$(python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)") \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_Python3:BOOL=ON \
      -DFRAMEWORK_USE_pybind11:BOOL=ON .
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Disclaimer:** The python bindings are currently supported on Linux.

\section how-to-use-the-libraries How to use the libraries
The **bipedal-locomotion-framework** provides native `CMake` support which allows the library to be easily used in `CMake` projects.

**bipedal-locomotion-framework** exports the `CMake` targets presented in Exported components section. The targets can be imported using the `find_package`  command and used by calling `target_link_libraries`.

For instance, `Math` component can be used as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cmake}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(myproject)
find_package(BipedalLocomotionFramework COMPONENTS Math REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE BipedalLocomotion::Math)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
